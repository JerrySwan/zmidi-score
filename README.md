### Representing a MidiFile as a musical score

This library was designed to be able to statistically analyse large corpora
of MIDI files. The library is based on the ZMidi.Core library: 
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/zmidi-core 

This repository is a fork of the original, with only minor modifications (if any). The original repo can be found at: <https://bitbucket.org/bash/zmidi-score>
